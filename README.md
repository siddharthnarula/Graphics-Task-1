# Discription
The following includes the task of the current week that require proper practice of the following tools to make an IMAGE a PNG by removing the background
# Move Tool
The Move Tool is the first tool visible in the default Toolbar. You can also access it by typing “V.”

It allows you to move items in your image. If you’ve created a selection within your image, you can use the Move Tool to relocate it within the frame. If you don’t have a selection, the Move Tool will move the entire layer.

# Rectangular Marquee Tool and Elliptical Marquee Tool
The Marquee Tools make quick selections within your image.

By default, the Rectangular Marquee Tool is visible just under or beside the Move Tool, depending on how you have your Toolbar configured.

To access the Elliptical Marquee Tool, click and hold, and then select the Elliptical Marquee Tool from the dropdown. You can access whichever Marquee Tool is currently visible by typing “M.”

With either the Rectangular Marquee Tool or Elliptical Marquee Tool selected, click and drag on your image to create your selection. The Rectangular Marquee Tool will create a rectangular selection; the Elliptical Marquee Tool will create an elliptical selection.

# Lasso Tool, Polygonal Lasso Tool and Magnetic Lasso Tool
The Lasso Tools, like the Marquee Tools, create a selection within your image.

Any of the three Lasso Tools may be visible in the Toolbar; click and hold on the visible tool to access the other Lasso Tools. You can access whichever Lasso Tool is currently visible by typing “L.”

With the Lasso Tool selected, you can draw a selection around any part of your image using your mouse. Click and hold the mouse button down as you draw. End the selection where you began to create a complete selection. 

# Magic Wand Tool
The Magic Wand Tool selects a portion of your image that has the same or similar colors.

You can access the Magic Wand Tool by typing “W.” If you don’t see the Magic Wand Tool, you can access it by clicking on the Quick Selection Tool and selecting the Magic Wand Tool from the dropdown.

# Quick Selection Tool
The Quick Selection Tool selects an object in your image by interpreting and selecting along defined edges visible in your image.

Over your image, the Quick Selection Tool will appear as a small circle with “+” inside of it. Place the cursor over an area of the object you wish to select and click. The tool will select a portion of your image, ending at any defined edges.

# Crop Tool
The Crop Tool allows you to rotate and crop your image along predefined parameters. The Crop Tool is especially useful if you have a series of product images that all need to be the same size and orientation.
